# TWO SUM Test Vectors
# You don't need to test all possiblities, or redudundant inputs.
# In a few test cases, you can test: at bounds, and special cases.
# POSITIVE SUM (+) + (+) = (+)
9:5:3,4,1,8,7:2,3
# POSITIVE SUM (+) + (-) that gives (+)
9:5:4,10,5,6,-1:1,4
# POSITIVE SUM (+) + (-) that gives (-)
-2:5:0,5,-7,8,4:1,2
# POSITIVE SUM (-) + (-) = (-)
-5:5:-1,-4,7,8,4:0,1
# MIN
6:2:3,3:0,1
# SUM to 0
7:4:9,0,7,8:1,2
# AT BOUNDS
6:3:3,2,3:0,2
